					<p></p>
					<p>
						Once, this forest was but barren and empty. One species lived in this land tasked with the
						caretaking of the valley.
						<br>
						Their care lead the valley to grow. Seed turned into plants, plants turned into trees, and so
						the valley slowly became a forest.
						<br>
						The species evolved into two beings: one for the shade, to take care of the plants and the
						trunks, and one for the trees, to help grow the branches and leaves.
					</p>

					<p>
						But as time went on, the shade grew darker and darker. Light started fading completely in some
						areas of the forest, leading life down below to die.
						<br>
						The Luma kept on working, as they were never able to see the destruction brought to the shade.
						<br>
						The Umbra only had one option: show the light people the death and destruction that their
						carelessness brought upon the shade.

					<h3 class="drop-shadow">The Project</h3>
					<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/oxfam logo small.png" alt="" /></span>
						This is a project we made in collaboration with OXFAM.
						<br>
						Our goal was to shed light on the invisible worker. These are workers that cannot let their
						voice be heard because they are afraid of being replaced. We wanted to make the game enjoyable
						in its own right and not make it too preachy,
						so we decided to work with metaphors.
						<br>
						The shadow is a metaphor for invisibility and the light for visibility. When the player stands
						in the light, the characters becomes brighter as well, signaling that he's become visible. While
						you need this visibility to solve puzzles in the game,
						the Luma or the "light people" do not appreciate you becoming visible and start to chase you on
						sight. When they catch you, you are replaced and you must chooce a new name for your character.
					</p>
					<p>I was the developer on this project and created all the gameplay code. </p>
